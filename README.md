# üçì Raspberry Pi System Monitor üñ•Ô∏è

A simple Python script for monitoring system parameters on a Raspberry Pi, just for fun and to practice Python! üêç

## Overview

This project provides a Python script (`system_monitor.py`) that continuously logs various system parameters of a Raspberry Pi, such as CPU usage, CPU temperature, RAM usage, and network activity. The logged data is stored in a text file (`system_log.txt`) for monitoring and analysis.

The script utilizes the `psutil` library to gather system information and the `vcgencmd` command to retrieve the CPU temperature on Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- Monitor CPU usage percentage.
- Get real-time CPU temperature.
- Track RAM usage percentage.
- Record network data (bytes sent and received).

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Raspbian or similar Linux distribution.
- Python 3.x installed.
- `psutil` library installed (install using `pip install psutil`).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/855princekumar/raspberry-pi-system-monitor.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
   cd raspberry-pi-system-monitor

3. Install the required psutil library:
    ```bash
    pip install psutil

4. Run the system monitor script:
   ```bash
   python3 system_monitor.py

5. Sit back and watch as the script logs system parameters to system_log.txt!

## Sample Output
   Here's an example of the logged output in system_log.txt:
   
    2024-04-22 12:00:00 - CPU Usage: 12.5% | CPU Temp: 52.5¬∞C | RAM Usage: 35.7% | Sent: 12345 bytes | Received: 54321 bytes
    2024-04-22 12:01:00 - CPU Usage: 10.2% | CPU Temp: 53.0¬∞C | RAM Usage: 36.1% | Sent: 12456 bytes | Received: 55432 bytes
